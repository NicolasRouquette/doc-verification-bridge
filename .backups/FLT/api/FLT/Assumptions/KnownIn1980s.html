an arbitrary theorem.</p><h2 class="markdown-heading" id="Usage">Usage <a class="hover-link" href="#Usage">#</a></h2><p>KMB will allow uses of <code><a href="../.././FLT/Assumptions/KnownIn1980s.html#knownin1980s">knownin1980s</a></code> in the FLT repo,
but only when it is used to prove a result which he is
convinced that he is able to prove on paper
using only results which were well-known pre-1990.</p><p>An invocation of <code><a href="../.././FLT/Assumptions/KnownIn1980s.html#knownin1980s">knownin1980s</a></code> must always be accompanied by comments
which indicate how one might prove this theorem using only results
which were in the mathematical literature before 1990. Ideally this
is a concrete reference to the pre-1990 literature. However, during
this phase of the project, a commented sketck of an argument
which is not explicitly in the literature but which is relatively
short and uses only techniques known in the 1980s is fine.</p><h2 class="markdown-heading" id="Ultimate-deprecation-of-the-tactic">Ultimate deprecation of the tactic <a class="hover-link" href="#Ultimate-deprecation-of-the-tactic">#</a></h2><p>KMB's vision of the evolution of the FLT project is as follows.
In this initial stage of evolution, we allow liberal usage
of the tactic to justify <em>any</em> proof which was known to humanity
pre-1990, ranging from standard results about elliptic curves
or modular forms to deep theorems such as the work of Mazur
on elliptic curves, Taylor and others on attaching Galois representations
to Hilbert modular forms, Langlands on cyclic base change
and so on. The first goal of the project should be to get a proof
of FLT which is sorry-free but which uses <code><a href="../.././FLT/Assumptions/KnownIn1980s.html#knownin1980s">knownin1980s</a></code> liberally.</p><p>After this initial phase, the work will turn to completely removing
the use of <code><a href="../.././FLT/Assumptions/KnownIn1980s.html#knownin1980s">knownin1980s</a></code>, replacing it with a much smaller list
of mathematical statements (perhaps around ten), each of which will
have a clear reference to a pre-1990 statement in the literature
and each of which will probably represent a serious formalization
challenge.</p><p>KMB is optimistic that both of the above phases can be achieved by
September 2029, when the EPSRC funding for the proposal runs out.
At that point we shall review the status of autoformalization tools
and see whether the process can be finished by such tools, or whether
more manual work will be required.</p></div><div class="decl" id="knownin1980s"><div class="axiom"><div class="gh_link"><a href="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT/blob/3241815d18908e47af83c0d5be8ef8455ee8ab3f/FLT/Assumptions/KnownIn1980s.lean#L57-L76">source</a></div><div class="verification_link">
