# Optional fields (all can override global settings):
#   classification_mode: "auto" (default) or "annotated"
#     - auto: Use heuristic-based automatic classification
#     - annotated: Only classify declarations with @[api_*] annotations
#   subdirectory: path within repo to Lean project (for monorepos)
#   lake_exe_cache_get: true to run `lake exe cache get` before build (for mathlib4)
#   disable_equations: true to disable equation generation (avoids timeouts)
#   skip_proof_deps: true to skip proof dependency extraction (faster)
#   proof_dep_workers: number of parallel workers for proof dep extraction (0 = sequential)
#   proof_dep_blacklist: array of theorem names to skip during proof dep extraction (for slow theorems)
#   html_workers: number of parallel workers for HTML file writing (0 = sequential)
#   use_doc_gen4_fork: use doc-gen4 fork for bidirectional navigation
