# Optional fields:

#     - auto: Use heuristic-based automatic classification
#     - annotated: Only classify declarations with @[api_*] annotations
#   subdirectory: path within repo to Lean project (for monorepos)
#   lake_exe_cache_get: true to run `lake exe cache get` before build (for mathlib4)
#   disable_equations: true to disable equation generation (avoids timeouts)
